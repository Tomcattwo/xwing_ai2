<h2>Purpose:</h2>

<p>Provide AI control of one or more ships for the Heroes of the Aturi Cluster (HotAC) Rebel Cooperative Campaign and Flight Group Alpha (FGA) Imperial Cooperative Campaign for the X-Wing Miniatures Game, using HotAC 2nd edition Version 2.07.04, Flight Group Alpha 2nd Edition Version 205_101 (with AI Pack 7.1) and FFG's 2nd Edition ruleset.</p>

<h2>Materials Needed to Play:</h2>
<ol>
<li>To Play the Heroes of the Aturi Cluster Rebel Cooperative Campaign, you will need to download the HotAC Campaign book, mission pack and all printable materials from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FuTxsSqbqqsiPm7Ayo5aX2daVloQ3RhM">Heroes of the Aturi Cluster 2.0 Conversion</a> by Shaun Tiernan.<br>
This is the same version of HotAC that has been exported for use in Vassal, with Shaun's permission.</li>
<li>To play Flight Group Alpha - An Imperial Cooperative Campaign, you will need to download the FGA Campaign and Mission Books (Ver 205_001) and AI Cards (Ver 7.1) from <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/161035/flight-group-alpha-imperial-co-operative-campaign">Flight Group Alpha - An Imperial Co-Operative Campaign on boardgamegeek.com</a>
<li>Then you will need to print off and cut out the various new terrain materials, reference cards, mission cards, Pilot Cards etc...</li>
<li>You will also need a sufficient number of X-WIng 2nd Edition Miniatures models, cards, tokens etc. between all the players to play each mission in your chosen campaign.</li>
<li>You will need to access this HotAC 2 AI program, either online using the x-wing-ai.com website or you can <a href="http://x-wing-ai.com/dist/xwing_ai2.zip">download your very own copy of x-wing-ai here</a>. The program contains all the AI ships for both campaigns (HotAC or FGA).<br>
</ol>
This web-based application, HotAC 2nd Edition Artificial Intelligence (AI), and FGA AI Ver 7.1, faithfully recreates the HotAC and FGA 2.0 AI developed by Claes Sorennson and Flight Group Alpha
for both cooperative campaigns.<br>
This program mirrors the "FGA Imperial AI Cards V7.1" for all Empire ships (8) used in HotAC, all Rebel (8), Scum (9) and First Order (2) ships used in the FGA campaign, and does the "dice rolling" for you for AI maneuvers.<br>
It also lists the prioritized activities in each phase that you will use for decision-making for the AI ships in either campaign, in an easy to see and use form.

<h2>Setup:</h2>
Read the HotAC/FGA Campaign book, and set up the campaign with 2 to 5 of your star-pilot friends as you take on the Empire in the Aturi Cluster or start your Imperial Pilot careers fresh out of the Academy in Flight Group Alpha!
Setup each mission per the Campaign directions using standard X-Wing 2nd Edition rules.

<h2>Usage Overview:</h2>

On the AI main page, for each AI controlled ship, during each round, you will:<br>

<ol><li>Click on the Faction and ship picture on the left side of the page for the AI ship you are controlling.</li>
<li>The page will update to show the selected ship"s icon in the middle of an "aiming reticle" field, the ship's stats, abilities and all prioritized activities the ship can perform in each phase.</li>
<li>Each sector of the "aiming reticle" corresponds to the location where the Target Ship is in relation to the AI ship, and is a "live" (clickable) area.</li>
<li>When you are ready to select the AI ship's maneuver, you will click on the appropriate sector, and the app will "roll the dice" and update the potential maneuvers.</li></ol>

<h2>The Game Round:</h2>
<ol>
<li><b>Planning Phase:</b> AI ships do nothing during the Planning Phase.</li>
<li><b>System Phase:</b> AI ships carry out any actions listed under the <b><span style="color:teal">System Phase</span></b> header on the app (only the TIE Phantom has <b><span style="color:teal">System Phase</span></b> activity).</li>

<li><b>Activation Phase:</b></li>
<ol>
<li>Pick a Target (human-controlled) ship for the AI ship using the priorities shown under <b><span style="color:teal">Select Target</span></b>.</li>
<li>Click on the location on the "aiming reticle" that matches the location of the Target ship (relative to the AI ship).<br>
The app will update the four possible maneuvers the AI ship can perform, depending on the range of the Target ship from the AI ship and whether the AI is "Stressed".</li>

<li>Move the AI Ship using the displayed maneuver:
<ul>
<li>Choose the <b>"Tgt R1/R2(Closing)"</b> maneuver if the Target ship is <b><span style="color:LightPink">in Range 1</span></b> or is <b><span style="color:LightPink">in Range 2 and facing towards</span></b> the the AI ship ("Closing" aspect).<br>
The HotAC/FGA Campaign books provide more details on how to determine the Target's aspect.</li>
<li>Choose the <b>"R2(Fleeing)/R3"</b> maneuver if the Target ship is <b><span style="color:LightSalmon">in Range 2 and facing away</span></b> from the AI ship ("Opening" aspect) or is <b><span style="color:LightSalmon">in Range 3</span></b>.</li>
<li>Choose the <b>"R4+"</b> maneuver if the Target ship is <b><span style="color:LightGreen">further than Range 3</span></b> from the AI ship.</li>
<li>Choose the <b><span style="color:red">"AI Stressed"</span></b> maneuver if the AI ship has a <img src="img/Stress_small.png" alt="Stress" title="Stress"> token.</li>
</ul>
Remember that AI ships do NOT gain a <img src="img/Stress_small.png" alt="Stress" title="Stress"> token as a result of conducting a <span style="color:red">"Difficult" (Red)</span> maneuver.<br>
However, they may <b>not</b> take an action in the Action portion of the Activation Phase if they conducted a <span style="color:red">"Difficult" (Red)</span> maneuver.<br>
AI ships CAN gain a <img src="img/Stress_small.png" alt="Stress" title="Stress"> token as a result of other game mechanics, such as collisions with obstacles, executing an action, card direction, etc.<br>
See the appropriate HotAC/FGA Campaign Book for details.</ol>
<li>In the Action portion of the Activation Phase, if allowed, choose the Action for the AI ship using the <b><span style="color:teal">Action Selection"</span></b> priorities listed on the app.<br>
Don't forget to take any other additional allowed actions resulting from ship/pilot abilities, card direction, etc.</li>
<li><b>Engagement Phase:</b> Select the Attack Target for the AI ship using the priorities listed on the app under <b><span style="color:teal">Attack Priorities</span></b>.<br>
Note that the Attack Target might not be the same target that was used for maneuver selection! That is perfectly fine.<br>
Conduct engagement using X-Wing 2nd edition rules.</li>
<li><b>End Phase:</b> Remove all circular tokens. AI ships carry out any actions listed under the <b><span style="color:teal">End Phase</span></b> header on the app (only the TIE Phantom has <b><span style="color:teal">End Phase</span></b> activity).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Notes:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ships move in Initiative Order from Lowest Initiative to Highest Initiative</li>
<li>AI ships never get a stress token as a result of executing a difficult maneuver, but may not perform any actions after a <span style="color:red">RED</span> maneuver.</li>
<li>AI ships can get a stress token as a result of interacting with an obstacle (for example, space debris) or executing a <span style="color:red">RED</span> action.</li>
<li>Always use secondary weapons, ship abilities upgrade functions or optional pilot skills for each AI ship, when and as applicable.</li>
<li>Have fun and use HotAC+FGA x-wing-ai.com AI to help you enjoy your HotAC and FGA Cooperative campaigns and ease some of the mechanics of game play. It's a tool, so use it however it fits your play style.</li>
