This folder is to allow for users to download the distributable file from a live web hosted environment. Place the /dist folder with the distributable xwing_ai2.zip inside it) in the root folder of the hosted website. Replace "info.htm" and "info2.htm" with the two files here in the root folder. This will allow users to hit the link to download the distributable for offline use. 

The distributable version contains no links to download the distributable zip file. Saves space and it would be sort of useless.
