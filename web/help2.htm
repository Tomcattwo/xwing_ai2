<h2>Purpose:</h2>

Provide AI control of one or more ships for the X-Wing Miniatures Game, using FFG's 2nd Edition ruleset.

<h2>Setup:</h2>
Setup game per standard 2nd Edition rules, choosing any squadrons and or missions.

<h2>Usage:</h2>

On the AI main page, for each AI controlled ship:
<ol>
<li>Select the faction of the the AI controlled ship.</li>
<li>Select the ship type for the AI controlled ship.</li>
<li>Pick a target (human-controlled) ship for the AI ship to attempt to attack (see below for details).</li>
<li>Select the location on the targeting ring that matches the direction of target (human-controlled) ship.</li>

<li>Move the AI Ship using the displayed maneuver:
<ul>
<li>Choose the "Closing" maneuver if the Target ship is <b>in range</b> and facing towards the the AI ship.</li>
<li>Choose the "Retreating" maneuver if the Target ship is <b>in range</b> and facing away from the AI ship.</li>
<li>Choose the "Out-of-Range" maneuver if the Target ship is further than range 3 from the AI ship.</li>
<li>Choose the "Stressed" maneuver if the AI ship has a <img src="img/Stress.png" alt="Stress" title="Stress"> token.</li>
</ul>
<li>Choose the best Action for the AI (see below for how to do this).</li>
<li>Complete the round per standard rules.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Picking a Target:</h2>
There are multiple options for picking a target:<br>
<ol>
<li>Always pick the nearest possible target, or</li>
<li>Randomize target selection by rolling a 6-sided die:</li>
<ul>
	<li>1-2: take on the closest ship</li>
	<li>3-4: take on the most damaged ship</li>
	<li>5-6: take on the highest skilled pilot.</li>
</ul>
<li>or, Pick the target that makes the most sense for the AI to defeat, if you were playing the AI side.</li>
</ol>
<p>Whichever method you choose, use that method consistently throughout the game.</p>

<h2>Choosing an action:</h2>
Choose the first action that matches the criteria provided, based on the list of possible actions on the main page for the selected ship.<br>
Optional: Select the action or actions from the list of available actions for the selected ship that would most benefit the AI ship.<br><br>
If the selected ship can perform the Target Lock action, this is a <strong>free action</strong>. Choose this action plus <strong>another</strong> action that is available in the list.<br>
The AI ship loses the "free" target lock at the end of its turn.<br>
The AI ship must be able to perform actions on its turn to be able to use the "free" Target Lock action.<br>
If it is unable to perform any actions (due to performing a <span style="color:red">RED</span> maneuver, collision, or presence of a stress token, for example), it may not take the "free" Target Lock action this turn.<br><br>
The "free" Target Lock for the AI (on ships that can perform a Target Lock) provides for more of a challenge to the player.<br>
Feel free to ignore this rule if you like, but play consistently through the game no matter whether you choose to use AI "free" Target Locks or not.

<h2>NOTES:</h2>
<ul>
<li>ALWAYS choose the human controlled ship(s) maneuvers before choosing AI maneuvers.</li>
<li>AI ships never get a stress token as a result of executing a difficult maneuver, but may not perform any actions after a <span style="color:red">RED</span> maneuver.</li>
<li>AI ships can get a stress token as a result of interacting with an obstacle (for example, space debris) or executing a <span style="color:red">RED</span> action.</li>
<li>Always use secondary weapons, upgrade functions or optional pilot skills for each AI ship, when and as applicable.</li>
<li>Have fun and use XWingAI2 to help you improve your X-Wing TMG skills! It's a tool, so use it however it fits your play style.</li>
</ul>
