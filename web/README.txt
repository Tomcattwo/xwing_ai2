                           No changes to 1st edition files
5/19/2020  1.14.01/2.0.2    (Tomcattwo) Updated 2nd Edition AI to version 2.0.2. This was a major update which included:

			   1) Added ships for 2nd Edition Wave 4 (Hyena, Naboo N-1, Resistance Transport, Resistance Transport Pod (including Droid Pilot Variants), Wave 5 (BTL-B Y-Wing, Nantex Starfighter), Wave 6 (Fireball Racer, Maj Baron von Reg's TIE/ba), and Wave 7 (HMP Droid Gunship, LAAT/i, Xi-class Light Shuttle). 
			   2) Updated "huge" ships to delete Imperial Carrier, and added Gozanti and C-ROC cruisers (and faction variants).
			   3) Changed the way ship actions are generated by python in the compiler, and the way ship actions are identified in the xwingAI2.js file. In the original AI, ship actions were identified within the xwingai2.js file by the use of a primitive bitwise number (primitive enumeration) generated by the python code for each ship from its .xml file entry. The number represented the concatenation of all specific actions available for each ship, and was matched using bitmap comparison within the xwingai2.js file as a ship was selected. This worked fine, until the total number of actions for any/all x-wing miniatures ships/cards exceeded 31, because primitive "enumerated" bitmaps can only represent a maximum of 31 unique items. In order to get over this limitation, I changed ALL actions for ships to an array of strings for each individual ship (instead of the single number of a concatenated enumerated bitwise mapping). With this change, the number of possible actions is virtually unlimited, and the code to identify a selected ship's potential actions is much simpler and easier to maintain/add to as future new actions come about. This was a significant change which required changes to the python files (ship.py, generate.py), every ship in every .xml file (19 files, 85 unique ships/variants, including the new wave 5-7 files) and extensive code changes to the xwing_ai2.js file. While this was a lot of work, the results are worth the effort. Actions now work properly and are correctly represented (based on sirjorj's cgi xHUD website - http://xhud.sirjorj.com/xwing.cgi), and are better ordered to help the player identify the best action(s) to have the AI take to provide a more challenging game.
			   4) Added "Tooltips" for all icons in the Actions section of the AI page. Makes it easier for those who may be unfamiliar with all of the various action icons. Just hover the cursor over any icon to see the name of the action.
			   5) Changed the factions to be capitalized on the AI2 main screen (e.g., "Rebel" vice "rebel" and "First Order" vice "1storder"). This required changes to the following files: generate.py, every ship in every .xml file (19 files, 85 unique ships/variants, including the new wave 5-7 files) and minor code changes to the xwing_ai2.js file.
			   6) Updated all HTML pages for Tooltips for all icons. Minor updates to AI2 Help page to clarify instructions
			   7) No changes to 1st edition non-HTML files or stylesheet.

6/05/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2     Minor update to fix an incorrect maneuver for 1 ship.

6/10/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2/3.0.0 (Tomcattwo) Added an entirely new AI for "Heroes of the Aturi Cluster" (HotAC) Rebel cooperative campaign game. HotAC for 1st edition was designed by Josh Derkson.
HotAC for 2nd Edition rules was updated by Shaun Tiernan, assisted by Claes Sorrenson and the members of Flight Group Alpha (HotAC Imperial A.I.), Bill Waller (Campaign Book and Mission Pack Layout), Justin Gan (Elite Pilot Cards and Player Record Cards Layout), and Dovi Anderson (additional Pilot Ability Cards). The new AI contains a "scratch built" xwing_ships3.js file, extensively modified html and xwing_ai3.js files, and added a number of new images. The new
HotAC AI is a faithful representation of the 2.07.04 Imperial AI cards developed by Claes Sorrenson and the Alpha Flight Group for HotAC 2nd Edition, and is a signifcant step up from AI1 or AI2. However iot contains AI for only the eight Empire ships used in HotAC. Changes were made to the html files for 1st and 2nd edition to fix some broken icons and to allow for switching back and forth between HotAC AI and AI1/AI2. No changes were made to the AI1 or AI2 javascript files. Additions were made to the style sheet, but no older styles were altered. 

6/18/2020  1.14.01/2.0.2/3.1.0 (Tomcattwo) Appended an additional 19 ships (8 Rebel, 9 Scum, 2 First Order) to incorporate AI for Flight Group Alpha Imperial Cooperative Campaign to HotAC AI
Completely updated the xwing_ai3.js and xwing_ships3.js files with many changes and new subroutines, and actions. (e.g., added a reroll function, etc.), made links changes to the .html files and minor additions the the style sheet, updated the help and info html files.
Added Flee Tables for each ship. This is a faithful representation of Claes' AI version 7.1 for all 27 ships used in both campaigns, with exception of correction of some maneuver areas in the original AI.
Changes were made to the AI2 xwing_ships2.js javascript file to correct several errors I caught in there on maneuvers while double-checking the new AI. No changes were made to AI 1 or xwing_ai2.js. Additions were made to the style sheet, but no older styles were altered.

6/21/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2/3.1.1 (Tomcattwo) Corrections to maneuver tables prior to publishing based on review and recommendations for improvement by Hipsu (Thank You!!). Also added reroll capability for Flee Hyperspace Maneuvers, a "blink" function when you click on a sector
to let you know it accepted the click (especially useful for tablet users) and a mini ship-image appears in the sector the user clicks on (tie fighters for rebels, scum and FO AI, x-wings for Empire AI.

6/23/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2/3.1.2 (Tomcattwo) "Blink" process didn't work properly for mobiles (tablets and phones); devised a new process to make it work properly. At Hipsu's request, eliminated the green "Bullseye" overlay on all FGA_image_maps.
Added functionality to prevent context menu (right click or long press on mobiles) from popping up on main page. This was a problem when pressing too long on a sector on mobile devices
Fixed xwing_ai.js to correct issue of capitalizing target sector filenames for images done during ai2 development. Restores ai1 functionality.
Added a thank you note to Hipsu (Miikka Sohlman) on info3.htm page and in this README.txt file
Changed label colors from teal to cyan in style.css
Files changed: index3.htm, info3.htm, style.css, xwing_ai3.js, xwing_ai.js, xwing_ships3.js (just to change the version number) and adding the new images.

6/29/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2/3.1.3 (Tomcattwo) Added Maneuver Tables for each HotAC and FGA ship on Main page and Ships page, with permission from sirjorj for use of screen grabs of the tables from http://xhud.sirjorj.com/xwing.cgi.
Files changed: xwing_ai3.js, xwing_ships3.js and adding the new maneuver table images.

7/9/2020 1.14.01/2.0.2/3.1.4 (Tomcattwo) Updated xwing_ships3.js and xwing_ai3.js for FGA AI Version 7.2. Minor changes to the readmes and help3.htm indicating AI update for FGA to version 7.2. No changes to ai 1 or 2 files.

The 2nd Edition AI, Combined fileset, and HotAC+FGA AI work is dedicated to the memory of my stepson, Chris Glidden,a devoted Star Wars fan and X-Wing player, who lost his year-long fight with pancreatic cancer on February 9, 2019. Chris was a Jedi Knight, right to the very end. May the Force always be with you, son.
