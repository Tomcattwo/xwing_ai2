NOTE: The generator and build files in this folder ONLY BUILD the 2nd edition xwing_ships2.js java script file. 

To build the 
1st edition AI xwing_ships.js file, go to the latest configuration folder for the 1st edition fileset (currently build 1.14.0 - all of these files are located in a GIT Branch: xwing_ai_1.14.0), and use ANT 
to build it there, then copy the new xwing_ships.js file to the AI Combined/web/src folder, overwriting the old 
xwing_ships.js file.
