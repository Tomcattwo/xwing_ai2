NOTE: The generator and build files in this folder ONLY BUILDS the 2nd edition xwing_ships2.js java script file. 

To build the 
1st edition AI xwing_ships.js file, go to the latest configuration folder for the 1st edition fileset, and use ANT 
to build it there, then copy the new xwing_ships.js file to the AI Combined/web/src folder, overwriting the old 
xwing_ships.js file.

The HotAC xwing_ships3.js file is HAND BUILT, not generated by ANT/Python/XML! It contains only 8 Empire ships, and is a one-off, due to the signficant changes required to accomodate the HotAC update. Do NOT try to build it!
